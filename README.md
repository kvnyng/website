# Website
Welcome to the repo for my personal site! Herein lies all my written content, projects, and other doohickeys.

The site is powered by `Hugo` and uses the `Blowfish` theme. For those who run WSL, run `sh run.sh`, a function that binds to your IP address. Otherwise simply run `hugo server` to get started!
